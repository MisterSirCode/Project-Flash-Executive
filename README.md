# Project-Flash-Executive
Secondary to my Compiled Flash Games repo, this is a C# Based App that can run EXE based Flash games offline!

All the games/tools provided in this app will be DISCLOSED as NOT MINE!!!! 

Im simply trying to continue a dying legacy of flash games that I have recompiled and collected. I still continue to make them at the moment. All flash api FLA/Exe's are located in the Apps folder of the project.

The reason Im making it "exe based" is because running a web-player in C# is complicated, and if i want to link MANY games, it would take many many many large portions of data.
Its simply something that I have no idea how to do. Exe based apps will be simple, effective, will work offline, and it will make my life 10x Easier.

Also if you do wish to request a game, follow my instructions on my "Compiled Flash Games" Repository to request a game. Please make sure the game is atleast a bit appropriate, and isn't a paid game like MAD2.
